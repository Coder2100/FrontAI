       <h1>Artificial intelligence devices</h1>
    <p class="content">This website dsiplays information about artificial intelligence.</p>
    <p class="content">Artificial intelligence (AI) is defined by techopedia as an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines [ and devices] that work and react like humans. In this assignment, I explored real life use cases where AI devices are used to power innovation.</br>The AI is all around us, it is powering our smart-phones from sorting of contacts by recent called to calendor notifications that can be easily synchronisyed with work schedule.The industrial revolution that we are in is called the 4th Industrial Revolution. </p>

    <p class="content">Professor Klause Scwarb, the renown economist and the founder of the World Economic Forum (WEF) once said, the Fourth Industrial Revolution doesn't change the way we do things, it changes us.</p>
    <p class="content">According to Techopedia,The core problems of artificial intelligence include programming computers for certain traits such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Knowledge.</li>
        <li>Reasoning.</li>
        <li>Problem solving.</li>
        <li>Perception.</li>
        <li>Learning.</li>
        <li>Planning.</li>
        <li>Ability to manipulate and move objects.</li>
      </ul>
   </p>

    <h2>Will your boss at work be a Robot?</h2>
     <p>Yes, Maybe or No.The answer depends on the industry that one chooses.This is inevitable given the bias in decision making by big organizations, a need for a more neutral decision maker is needed. <p>
    <p> For the first time, in 2014  <strong>Vital</strong> was appointmented as board member of board of directors by Hong-Kong venture capital firm Deep Knowledge. The robot, named Vital, was chosen for its ability to pick up on market trends â€˜not immediately obvious to humans.

    <h2>How Government can use AI to save Fiscus?</h2>
   
      <p>AI has a huge role to play in government where there are complicated procurement processes to be followed.AI can help curb the corruption by a factor of 2.With that said,it w be impossible to mislead the robot in tender processes. <p>For example if certain mortivating document for a tender has nt been submitted,an AI agent will block the awarding of that tender or block any transfer of funds from the state to malicious accounts that are not on the treassury database as prescribed.</p>
